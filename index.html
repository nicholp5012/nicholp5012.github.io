  <p id="body_text">"I have been fond of great food ever since I was a baby. Though, ionically I was always a very picky eater according to my mom" 
  
    Quoting her exactly "He likes very little, but eats alot of what he does likes". Also, a constant line I get is that "Nicholas don't tough the snacks". Lastly, the best part is I'm in great shape and I can eat all the maels I please with little consideration. Thanks for visiting my first website that's it. BYE!!! </p> </div>
